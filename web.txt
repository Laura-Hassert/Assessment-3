How does the internet work? What happens when you click on a link?
    The internet is a large network made up of a bunch of smaller networks. Each network, device, and server has an IP address that can also have a "nickname" being it's host name for easier access for people. Most people access specific networks by entering the host name in the browser. The routers control the path that the request, or packet, takes to get to the destination. The DNS (Domain Name System) server is used to help match the host name and IP address to help route the request to the correct destination. 
    
    When you click on a link, your request is immediately sent to a local router. That router then sends it to other routers. It will pass throught he DNS server to interpret the URL to the IP address and eventually it is directed to the end server. The receiving server holds the data that you are requesting access to. That server then sends a response back, by way of routers, until it makes it back to your computer and the browser loads the requested page. This all takes place in a matter of seconds.
